## The Topics Description
### Linear Regression
  In a basic linear regression, there is just one explanation variable taken into account. The objective is to establish a linear link between the answer and this variable. Several fields find usage for linear regression, such as Environmental Science, where it is employed to investigate air pollution, infectious illnesses, and land use, and Machine Learning, where linear regression is crucial to machine learning models.
### Logistic Regression
  A statistical model called logistic regression calculates an occurrence's probability of happening given a set of independent factors.  In binary logistic regression, the independent variables may be continuous or binary, whereas the dependent variable is binary (coded as "0" or "1").  Predicting a patient's propensity to have a specific ailment (e.g., diabetes).
This is applied in the following areas: Finance: Determining the likelihood of a loan default.
Marketing: Calculating the probability of consumer attrition.
Sports: Projecting a game's result.
### Diference of Regresssion
  Comparing Logistic Regression with Linear Regression: Logistic regression is more concerned with probability than linear regression is with continuous result prediction. While logistic regression models the log-odds (logarithm of the odds), linear regression models the mean response directly.
