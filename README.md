# Activities and Midterm Compilation CSEL302

## Introduction
Welcome to the collection of exercises for CSEL 302, which includes not only the lab activities but also the midterm examination. This set includes all the activities we did in the lab, given by our professor Mr. Bernardino. It also includes the practical part of the midterm exam. Plus, there's a summary of all the topics we covered in the course.

## The Topics
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Difference of Regressions

## The Topics Description
### Linear Regression
In a basic linear regression, there is just one explanation variable taken into account. The objective is to establish a linear link between the answer and this variable. Several fields find usage for linear regression, such as Environmental Science, where it is employed to investigate air pollution, infectious illnesses, and land use, and Machine Learning, where linear regression is crucial to machine learning models.

### Logistic Regression
A statistical model called logistic regression calculates an occurrence's probability of happening given a set of independent factors.  In binary logistic regression, the independent variables may be continuous or binary, whereas the dependent variable is binary (coded as "0" or "1").  Predicting a patient's propensity to have a specific ailment (e.g., diabetes). This is applied in the following areas: Finance: Determining the likelihood of a loan default.
Marketing: Calculating the probability of consumer attrition.
Sports: Projecting a game's result.

### Difference of Regresssion
Comparing Logistic Regression with Linear Regression: Logistic regression is more concerned with probability than linear regression is with continuous result prediction. While logistic regression models the log-odds (logarithm of the odds), linear regression models the mean response directly.

## Conclusion
Using the Github it became flexible to share files for real-time collaboration. Git keeps track of every change made to files in the repository. It also help with the documentatio of the works. GitHub is not only a powerful platform for version control but also a hub for collaboration, learning, and efficient software development. Whether youâ€™re a developer, researcher, or student, GitHub can transform your development process
