# Activities and Midterm Compilation CSEL302

## Introduction
Welcome to the collection of exercises for CSEL 302, which includes not only the lab activities but also the midterm examination. This set includes all the activities we did in the lab, given by our professor Mr. Bernardino. It also includes the practical part of the midterm exam. Plus, there's a summary of all the topics we covered in the course.

## The Topics
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Difference of Regressions

## The Topics Description
### Linear Regression
In simple linear regression, only one explanatory variable is considered. The goal is to establish a linear relationship between the response and this variable. Linear regression is utilized in various fields. For instance, in Environmental Science, it's used to study air pollution, infectious diseases, and land use. In Machine Learning, linear regression plays a vital role in creating models.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical model that calculates the probability of an event occurring based on a set of independent variables. In binary logistic regression, these independent variables can be either continuous or binary, while the dependent variable is binary ("0" or "1"). For example, it can predict a patient's likelihood of having a specific disease, such as diabetes. This model is widely used in several fields. In finance, it is used to determine the likelihood of a loan default. In marketing, it helps calculate the probability of consumer attrition. In sports, it can project the outcome of a game.

### Difference of Regresssion
When comparing logistic regression with linear regression, it's important to note their key differences. Logistic regression focuses primarily on probability. It is used to calculate the likelihood of an event occurring based on independent variables. On the other hand, linear regression is mainly concerned with predicting continuous outcomes based on an input variable. Therefore, logistic regression and linear regression have different applications and interpretations.

## Conclusion
GitHub makes it easy to share files for working together in real time. Git keeps a record of all changes made to the files. It also helps with work documentation. GitHub is a great tool for managing versions of software, and it's also a place for teamwork, learning, and effective software development. No matter if you're a developer, researcher, or student, GitHub can improve how you develop software.
